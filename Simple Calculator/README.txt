This is a simple C++ console application that performs four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.The user inputs two numbers and selects the desired operation through a menu-driven switch-case structure.
Ideal for beginners exploring:
- Control flow using switch
- Input/output in C++
- Basic arithmetic logic
Feel free to clone, fork, or expand with more features like modulus, exponentiation, or error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.
