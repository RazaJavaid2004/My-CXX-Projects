# 🧮 Simple Calculator in C++

This is a basic console application written in C++ that performs fundamental arithmetic operations between two user-provided numbers. It's designed to showcase beginner-friendly control flow and input/output handling using a `switch` statement.

## ✨ Features

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C++
- Standard I/O (`cin`, `cout`)
- Control flow (`switch` statement)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang)
- Command-line terminal or IDE (e.g., VS Code, Code::Blocks)

### How to Run

1. Compile the Code:
   ```bash
   g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator

2. Run the Executable:
   ```bash
   ./calculator

📦 Example
--------Main Menu----------
1- Addition
2- Subtraction
3- Multiplication
4- Division
5- Exit
Enter Your Choice: 1
Enter the Numbers:
2
3
Sum: 5

📈 Future Improvements- Input validation (e.g., division by zero handling)
- Support for more operations like modulus, exponentiation
- GUI version using SFML or Qt
- Unit tests for verifying logic
