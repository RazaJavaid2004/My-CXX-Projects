## 🛠️ Build Instructions

Each project includes its own `CMakeLists.txt` and can be built independently:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./<ProjectExecutable>
```

For Windows users, batch scripts (`run.bat`) are included where applicable.

## 🧪 Testing

Projects like **Student Record System** include unit tests using Google Test. To run tests:

```bash
./<TestExecutable>
```
